# P4President

## Description
This will be a game where your decisions will shape the politics of your country.
You get to play prime minister, president, king or whatever form of government you like.  
The input is open ended

## Idea
The game will start with an introduction to society and background. And the player will need to answer some questions, these will determine the first steps of his civilization.

There will be 20 stages to the game, 20 ocassions where you need to make a decision. 

The story commences, the player will have some options to select along his path.

Maybe a database with random ocurrences that affect the story and the player needs to make a choice. This will evolve his civilization towards different forms of government / society.

Add religions at some point?


## TODO

- [x] Sample historic forms of government
- [x] Create Vectorspace
- [x] First tests on querying the vectorspace
- [ ] Try small LLMs vs GPT 3/4
- [ ] Allow government selections
- [ ] Allow number of rounds selection
