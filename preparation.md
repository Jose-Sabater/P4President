Over the centuries, the Standords civilization flourished in the Fertile River Valleys. Under the wise rule of their leader, King Solomar the Great, the people of Standords developed a Tribalistic government, focused on understanding and knowledge of the world. They developed strong trading relationships with other civilizations, using their crafted goods and services to sustain their economy.

As the Standords civilization grew, so too did their need for a more organized government. King Solomar's son, King Darnell, introduced a Meritocratic system, allowing those who displayed the most knowledge and understanding of the world to take the lead in the government. This system of government led to a period 
of immense growth and prosperity for the Standords civilization, as knowledge was valued and rewarded greatly.

The Standords civilization continued to grow and develop under their Meritocratic system, eventually reaching an era of immense wealth and power. King Darnell's grandson, King Galen, saw the need for a stronger form of government and so introduced a Federalism system, allowing for the Standords people to have a say on how the government was run. Under this system, the Standords people flourished and prospered with an unprecedented level of wealth and power.
